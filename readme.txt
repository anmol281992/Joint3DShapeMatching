This package is an implimentation of matchALS algorithm for a 3D mesh: It does joint matching of multiple mesh simultaneously. Due to symmetrical human body , In an HKS or geodesic descriptor two mesh points will have same descriptor and hence we cannot segment left leg and right leg or left arm or right arm in the algorithm. We use reweighed random walk algorithm to solve the problem. 


main_code.m: In order to run the algorithm this file needs to be run.

compHKS.m: Compute the Heat kernel Signature for 3D mesh. Called in main_code.m to compute the HKS descriptor for 3D mesh in Data Directory.

compGeodesic.m: Compute the Geodesic descriptor for 3D mesh. Called in main_code.m to compute the Geodesic descriptor for 3D mesh in Data Directory.

mmatch_CVX_ALS.m: Runs the matchALS algorithm for descriptors in a 3D mesh.

assignColors.m: Assigns colour to multiple segments in the mesh based on the matching descriptor across multiple 3D meshes. 

gm-toolbox: A directory which stores the functionalities for Rewieghted Random Walk algorithm. 

Data: A directory containing the meshes I have worked with and the corresponding .mat files containing the geodesic and HKS descriptors generated by main_code.m. You can use your own mesh files. 

writeVTK.m: Matlab file to generate VTK files corresponding to desciptor matching in the mesh.
